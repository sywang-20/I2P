### 1. Who collected the data?
The data was collected by Inside Airbnb website, which was launched by Murray Cox. The data analysis and visualization activists collected the data and shared it on the website for others to do some analysis.

---
### 2. Why did they collect it?
They collected the data to do some analysis to investigate the way Airbnb is being used in cities all over the world and advocate people to protect the residential communities. Besides the data were also used to analyze whether there is illegal renting.

---
### 3. How was it collected?
The data analysis and visualization activists scraped the Airbnb website to collect the public information displayed on the Airbnb website like names, photos, reviews, availability and so on. Then, they verified, cleaned, analyzed and aggregated the data.

---
### 4. What useful information does it contain?
It contains a lot of useful information which can be divided into three main categories as follows:

(1)	information about the host

It contains the host’s information, such as their names, photographs, self-introductions.

(2)	information about the house

This part includes some information about the house which is going to be rented. For example, the location of the house, longitude, latitude and its photos.

(3)	information about rental

In this part, the information about rental the consumers need to know is contained, such as price, amenities and the reviews of the house. 

---
### 5.What useful information is it missing?

More detailed information about rental is missing. For example, the data should include deposit, cancellation policy, cleaning fee, whether guests’ photos and phone number are required. Besides, some columns lack many values such as host_response_rate, host_acceptance_rate. But these information is useful when analyze whether the host influence the guests’ decision.

---

### 6. To what extent is the data 'complete'?
The data is relatively complete and can be used to carry out various analysis, but it still misses some useful information which may be used in some analysis.

The data includes the information of rent houses in London and has abundant information about the host and the house. These information can support a lot of analysis such as how many houses are rent in London and where they are.

However, the data is lack of some information which can be used to do more analysis. Firstly, the information about rental is limited. We can only get a few information about rental, such as price and the length of rental. More detailed rental information can not be found. Secondly, some columns do not have any value or are obviously wrong. These columns do not have any meaning and should be dropped when we do analysis.

### 7. What kinds of analysis would this support?

The data can support a lot of analysis. 

Firstly, it can be used to do some basic analysis, such as “How many houses are for rental in London?” and “Which hosts received better review”. We can also set some conditions and find the houses which meet all the conditions. And what’s more, an app can be developed to recommend the houses for consumers based on this analysis. 

Secondly, the data can be also used by the government. It is obvious that Airbnb has an impact on residential communities. The government may need to know how Airbnb influences it and change the policies in time. Besides, the government can rely on the data to supervise the house rental market. 
At last, the data can support the analysis carried out by real estate companies and economical institutions in London to find out how Airbnb influence the local real estate and economy.

### 8. What kinds of analysis would it _not_ support?

The first type is the analysis that can’t be analyzed in more detail because of the lack of useful information. For example, when we try to analyze what influence the guests’ choice, the information of the host and the house is complete. However, there is little information about rental. Questions like whether the deposit is needed, do the guest need to pay cleaning fee and do the hosts offer meals are unknown.

The second type is the analysis may cause digital discrimination or even invade others’ privacy like analyzing the hosts’ property status.

### 9. Which of the uses presented in Q.7 and Q.8 are _ethical_?

Airbnb claims to protect users’ privacy and the data published on the website is the data that users are willing to disclose. Our dataset is collected from Airbnb and doesn’t involve any private data. However, it is difficult to guarantee how the data is used in the analysis. It is possible that the analysis may reveal some sensitive information. Therefore, the analysis should be carried out under the premise of not invading privacy or causing discrimination. As a result, the uses listed in question 7 and the first type of analysis listed in question 8 are all ethical since they do not involve any sensitive information.  

In particular, the government research is of great significance in terms of ethics. In London, there are some property laws and city rules that the hosts should comply with. For example, entire home listings on Airbnb can only be booked out for 90 days per calendar year. The government can use the data to analyze whether Airbnb comply with these regulations strictly, thereby restricting the Airbnb. In the article “ How Airbnb’s data hid the facts in New York city”, the data collected on the Inside Airbnb website is compared with the official report published by Airbnb and it was found that Airbnb removed nearly 1000 illegal listing in their report. The author revealed the fact to the public. Thus, analysis like this is meaningful and it can supervise the Airbnb.

However, it is not ethical to carry out the second type analysis listed in question 8. Topics like discrimination is relatively sensitive, especially in contemporary society with the Internet developing rapidly. If such research results are released on the Internet, some hosts and guests may suffer from online violence because they choose their guests or houses according to gender and race.
